# Introduction-to-Node.js
Code based on a Introduction to Node.js course by Linux Foundation, where we build a real-time connection between client and server. Also developing a CLI interface tool to interact with the server API.


Run in terminal localted inside the main folder:
  # serve -p 5050 static

In another tertminal run:
  # cd mock-srv
  # npm run dev
  
In adition, you can use the my-cli command interface to interact with the API inside mock-srv running the next command in another terminal:
  # my-cli
